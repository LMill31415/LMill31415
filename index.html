                <p>There's not too much to know about me except the fact that I made this game for school and that's
                    about all you really need to know about me.</p>

                <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
                <p>This game has a lot of NPCs that will try to scam you so try to be on the lookout. Or don't and get
                    scmmed maybe you will get something for it.</p>

                <h2>About the Game</h2>
                <p>The game in itself is not too complicated in just the fact that all you need to do is get too school.
                    It sounds simple but that's not really a good game if all you had to do was walk down the block to
                    get to school. Instead you are going to go on an adventure until you finally find your way to get to
                    the school.</p>

            <div class="smallBoxes">
                <h2>Progress</h2>
                <p>The game is very much not done. Not even close to being completed so don't expect to find the end of
                    the game. There are a few places where there might be a cutoff and I know. There is not game content
                    everywhere so don't expect for their to be game content everywhere.</p>
